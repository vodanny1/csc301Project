# Project Objectives:
Build an educational technology android application named UCourse where university students share notes,  access success packages and assign ratings to professors. The application will also specialize in homework help and online tutoring.
# Key User:
- Students
- Tutors
### Details 
- 19 year old Jessie is a second year student at the University of Toronto, studying Bachelors of Commerce (BCom). Jessie is trying to search for courses that have a low workload and high average grade, so that she can perform well and obtain a high GPA in her third year, but she is too embarrassed to ask her seniors and batchmates for advice. 
- 21 year old James is a first year student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Computer Science major. James is a bright student who performs very well in class and has achieved a 3.0 cgpa in his first year. He aims to score a 3.4 cgpa by the end of his second year. 
- Jennifer is a 24 year old computer science graduate student, that works at a startup company in downtown toronto. After work she would like to tutor students in computer science as she wants to pursue a university teaching profession. 
# Scenarios:
- Jessie a non-registered user would need to register so that she can have access to various courses offered at her university, with details including the average grade and workload, thereby allowing her to pick a suitable course. 
- James a registered user would need to download past course slides so that he can prepare for a lecture well in advance to fulfil his aim of having a 3.4 cgpa score by the end of his second year .
- James a registered user would need to look at past assignments and lecture notes for before an assessment him for extra practice, thereby allowing him to achieve his objective of a 3.5 cgpa score by the completion of his second year. 
- James a registered user would need to hire Jennifer to help him understand where he is falling short in understanding course material. He needs extra help to fulfil his university course aim of 3.5 cgpa by the end of second year. 
# Principals:
- Favor abstraction over implementation: Make sure to depend on the abstraction layer. 
- Put duplicate functionalities in some utility class and make it accessible through the whole application.
- Each class/method/module should have one reason to be changed. Give a single responsibility for each of them in order to minimize regressions.
- An easy to navigate UI needs to be implemented that will not have unnecessary features and information that will cluster the interface and confuse users.
