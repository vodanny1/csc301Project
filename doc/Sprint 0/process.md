# Process

Our team communicates through a Facebook Messenger group chat. Using that tool, we are able to share our ideas, codes, screenshots, troubleshooting, and also setup in person meetings. We try and schedule meetings where everyone is available and present different ideas on how to tackle our project.

If there is any conflict or clashes between the ideas, we discuss both pros and cons of each and decide together as a group as to which idea seems more feasible. We took everyone’s opinion regarding the project into consideration and tried to tweak it to everyone’s preference. We also do either in person polling or create online polls (if we can't meet in person) to help us decide on what to work on next.

The team was organize mostly through Piazza since we did not know each other. Communications to setup the team were done through Piazza searching for team members, e-mail to grab contact information, and Facebook for overall team communication. Our team created an excel spreadsheet where we were able to list all of our available time slots. This made it easier to schedule our meetings where everyone is present.  

We have communicated mostly through Facebook since it is most convenient, but we have also had 2 in person meetings; 1 was a scheduled in person while the other was through tutorial.

As of right now, in terms of roles we have divided up the work to each member. Here is the list of job that each person had to complete:

- summary.md - Anandi
- competition.md - Eashan
- personas.pdf - Eashan
- Product Backlog - Preet
- process.md - Danny
- User experience/ interface (Eashan, Ananda, James)

while all the other files such as team.md, done.md are completed together as a whole.

For user stories, we tried to prioritize ones that we believe would give us a basic working functionality of our app. We picked a story based on our current programming skills and if we were sure we were able to implement it before our next sprint.

Since this is one of the very few classes that require us to follow the protocols for the sprint, we are still getting used to it and learning. By becoming more familiar with it, it will make the workflow easier since we will know how to operate our meetings more efficiently. We are hoping that by our next sprint meeting, we can divide up the work on our project and implement some basic functions that allows our app to work.
