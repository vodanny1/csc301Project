## **_[Chegg](https://www.chegg.com):_**

Chegg operates as a website offering multiple services, including Buying/renting books, hiring tutors, checking for scholarships, obtaining textbook solutions and applying for internships.

## **_[StuDocu](https://www.studocu.com):_**

StuDocu also operates only as a website and offers students access to viewing and downloading documents such as past assignments, exams etc. filtered by universities and courses, in exchange for their contribution of further such documents. The website is still in its infancy and is focusing on expanding its user base and not profitability, at present.

## **_[Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com):_**

Like the previous two competitors, Course Hero also operates on a website based platform only, offering students access to documents, akin to StuDocu. Course Hero however has stricter requirements and allows only partial viewing of documents, requiring users to pay for further access or upload a multitude of documents. The website also offers tutoring and scholarship search help.

## **_[Triklo](https://triklo.com):_**

Another website only platform, Triklo offers students free and unlimited access to information on courses belonging to their universities, with details such as average grades, expected workload and past students’ comments.

## **_[Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com):_**

Rate My Professors provides information on professors belonging to various universities, including details such as a quality score, difficulty score, adjective tags, attendance requirements, tendency to stick to textbooks, student comments. It is the only competitor that operates on both a website as well as a mobile app based platform.

## **_Our Product’s Unique Selling Point (USP):_**

We offer multiple features including -

1. Course information (Average grades, workload, students’ advice/remarks etc.)
2. Professor information (Rating by students, feedback, teaching style etc.)
3. Documents (Lecture slides, handouts, assessments etc.)
4. Books (On demand books for purchase or rent)
5. Tutoring service (On demand paid tutoring service)

Hence, unlike the competitors listed above, our product is the only one which offers all of the comprehensive services to students, allowing us to be a part of their journey throughout their academic life.

Furthermore, unlike most of our competitors that operate solely on a website, our product focuses on mobile phone users, as more and more millennials are preferring the use of mobile phones for internet browsing, thus putting our product in an ideal position for capturing future users.

## **_Suitable User and/or Scenarios:_**

Scenario/User 1 -

Tim Cook is an incoming sophomore at the University of Toronto, studying Bachelors of Commerce (BCom) and scored a below average GPA of 2.30 in his freshman year at the university. Tim does not consider himself to be a bright student and is not passionate about the subjects he is studying and chose to study Commerce under parental and peer pressure. He is not a hard worker, but is worried about his GPA, as it would affect his social standing among his friends and peers, his relationship with his parents and his chances of securing a good job. Tim would like to opt for a course that has a low workload but high average grade, so that he can perform well and obtain a higher GPA, but is too embarrassed to ask his seniors and batchmates for advice. Our product would be ideal for him, as it showcases the various courses offered at his university with details including the average grade and workload, thereby allowing him to pick a suitable course.

Scenario/User 2 -

Elon Musk is a freshman who recently joined the University of Toronto and is in his second week of classes. Elon thought that he would not require to purchase textbooks for doing well in his courses, however, he now feels that he has fallen behind his classmates and needs extra practice and readings from the course textbook. Much to his dismay, the campus bookstore has already run out of the books required by him as the sell-out very quickly at the start of the semester. Elon can use our product to order his textbooks online and either purchase them outright or simply take them on rent to save money.

Scenario/User 3 -

Jeff Bezos is a junior at the University of Toronto, studying Mathematics. He is taking an algebra course this semester, but has thus far struggled to perform well in his course assessments. He is afraid that he may not receive a good grade and despite his hard work finds it difficult to grasp the concepts outlined in the syllabus. With his final exam approaching, Jeff wishes to receive some external help in understanding the subject better, in order to make up for his previous poor performances by doing well in the final exam. Jeff could use our product to request for online tutoring sessions, getting help from experts in the subject.

Scenario/User 4 -

Sundar Pichai is a bright student who performs very well in class. He ranks near the top of the class but is unable to get a firm grasp on the coveted number one ranked position in his class. He wishes to cover the gap and finally conquer the number one position by working extra-hard and practicing more from past materials. Sundar can use our platform for practicing past assessments including assignments and tests to improve his chances of scoring well and understanding where he is faltering in a course. He could also download past slides of a course to prepare for a lecture in advance.

## **_Reasons Why Competitors Did Not Focus On These Scenarios:_**

Each competitor targets a different section of the student community, instead of the community as a whole, in order to better focus on a single area. The websites also have suffered from stereotyping, as they are regarded as being good and well known at only one part of the education sector. For instance, although Course Hero offers tutoring services as well, it is primarily used for gaining access to documents, as that was the initial service offered by the website and made it popular. Similarly, when a student visits Rate My Professor, he/she associates it as a website where he/she can gain knowledge about a particular professor’s teaching style and not that of a particular course.

Thus, each and every competitor is attempting to champion one particular section of the educational sector, while offering some cross-selling opportunities like tutoring, but with a lack of success due to the reputation associated with them as being good at one particular offering.

## **_How Could Competitors Expand To Compete With Us More Directly:_**

Competitors could indeed expand to cover our offerings as well, however it would require several modifications and additions, including -

1. Change in business model
2. Hiring new staff with a completely different skillset/competency
3. Creating cross-selling opportunities to existing customers

In order to suddenly expand to compete with us, competitors would require a vast capital infusion and build up their knowledge in new arenas.
