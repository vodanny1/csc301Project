As a team we need to now focus on the finishing touches of the application. We need to make sure that the UI is easy to use and intuitive for the user to use. Moreover, for the presentation we need to make sure that we have 3-4 features finished from start to finish. Those features will be course information, professor rating, course upload and online forum. We need to continue the communication amongst ourselves as that has worked for us in the past sprints. We also need to make sure that the UI is consistent across all the different features. We need to communicate well as this sprint we will work together a lot. We had an issue with the git merge this sprint, so it is important that for the last sprint we fix our issues of merge ahead of time instead of leaving it last minute. As a team we had a successful demo last sprint and we should continue working hard, communicate and organize ourselves the same way to have the last sprint successful as well.
