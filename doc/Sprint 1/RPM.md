1. We chose Anandi Patel as our product owner. The product owner discussed how they wanted the project to turn out. The product owner gave us a general idea of the outcome and discussed the different features that they wish to be implemented into the final project.
2. Release Name and Theme: Basic Structure 1.0
This release focusses on the UI of the app and basic functionality such as signing up for an account, logging in, and logging out. We will test it through the compiler found in Android Studio for the view and basic functionality. 
3. We did not modify or change our definition of Done. Our main goal for it is still making all the features mentioned on pivotal tracker to work seamlessly together.
4. We haven't add many features since for this release, we want to get the basic structure down which sets a path way for feature features. We want to complete the view and basic account functionality first. 
5. We discussed the different user stories and started assigning a few of them to different members for next sprint schedule. We did try and further elaborate in person as to what the user stories meant and a general idea as how to implement them to fit that description.
6. As stated in Sprint 0, we were able to set up the meetings through our Facebook Messenger group chat. When it came time for the meeting, everyone was able to pitch in their thoughts and ideas. For little issues as to understanding some user stories, people gave out their perspective of how to view it and others would vote with whoever seemed more correct. We discussed about the basic functionality and ideas to implement it, the type of database we will need to store our courses, and our availability to dedicate to this project.
