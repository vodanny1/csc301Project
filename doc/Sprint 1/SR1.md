As a team we need to continue the constant communication across the team as it leads to a postivie work experience. We need to adapt to work on all layers of a feature and also need to demo on heroku. We will stop the harmful pratice of pushing on master before merging. As a team, we were successful to demo the software on time. On the other hand, we need to avoid leaving work till the last minute.
