As a team we should continue the working on the work that we have disucssed in the sprint meeting. We also need to make sure that we have enough time to have clean up stories in our next sprint. We need to also need to work on all layers of the user story. We need to communicate better across ourselves when individual's are working on the same story together. As a team we had a successful demo last sprint and we should continue working hard, communicate and organize ourselves the same way to have another successful sprint.
