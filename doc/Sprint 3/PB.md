# Numerical Series
- We are going to use a 1-5 series (i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) where 1 is highest priority and 5 is lowest priority to assign our priorities
- We are also going to use modified Fibonacci series point estimates to our user stories -> 0,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 80, 100, 400 where 0 is lowest complexity and 400 is highest complexity.
